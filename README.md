# PackMen Excercise

## Description
In this exercise, two buttons are displayed on the screen. “Add PacMen” creates PacMen in random positions. “Start Game” sends them off, chomping away. When the packmen reach the edge of the screen, they change direction.

## How To Run
This exercise can be run by forking the repository (button in upper left), cloning it to your machine, and dragging the index.html file into your browser window. The exercise can also be run from [here](https://russellpropert.github.io/MIT-MERN/07week/NextTech_PacMen_Factory_Exercise/index.html).

## Future Improvements
I may include ghosts and, if I’m feeling ambitions, eyes that track the same trajectory as the ghosts’ path.
